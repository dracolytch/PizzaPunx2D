Every other type of craft beer establishment in town mess up the microbrewing process; it's too sloppy - especially when it comes to adding yeast to their beer. I'm always wary of places that have higher incentives to actual craft beers but it takes 30 minutes to perfect a beer. I know k9s 26 hours short list, but to those who can get their hands on the best beer there will probably just be good, so use the market and their name... and then a place that has more in common with Urban Outdoors and GTA.","isGood":0,"insanityLevel":1,"gameStage":1,"needsChecking":0},"47":{"doNotUse":0,"content":"4 Stars: Fantastic pizza one of the best in the valley.

I worked in the store for 20 years and work during the summer and didn't know anything about frozen pizza in work.  I guess  it is their most run of the mill pizza business to be honest.  (I work in the Buy clothes department on the Fashion line)  I had heard this joke mentioned before and would suspect this place was quite good, and I talked with the sales guy and he looked ashamed.  And fixed my order almost a month before.  The pizza wasn't bad at all.  But I did recommend.  The pepperoni pizza was surprisingly good.  The sausage pizza was ok as well.  And they were a little generous with the shell I saw in the trash.  \r\n\r\nThe guy who delivered the pizza didn't even look at me when I called to order it at the register; then exclaimed, \"The guy just tipped all this dough off for us, maybe a whole bunch of it.\"  I helped take my order.  I was not trying to charge or pocket some money for them.  (Pro tip my own Super Bowl national championship, by the way.)  Or perhaps a little luck to avoid an injury to the pizza guy while you serve him your pizza.  \r\nI know this is nothing to flatter you at the waist of the racks, but the guy snatching the last piece of bacon off my cheese pizza was probably playing a basso banana console, begrudgingly rubbing some napkins out with each slice; and the sauce was enough to soak into my nose.  So maybe I should have scalded it right away to get some grease.  But don't let the \"in employee\" monkey kat's your 3 foot pizza envy visiting the store.
